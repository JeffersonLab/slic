_MC Bug Fixing with Ron Cassell_

2/11/2005

-too many Mcp in the cal hits
  -energy cut on saving particles? (CHANGE TO 1.0 MeV)

-too many particles per hit in cal hits
  -long, not super-long format (CHANGE IN LcioHCBuilder.cc)
    -needs combining logic
    -aggregate hits by unique track ids
      -McpHitContribList = aggregateMcpHitContribListByTrackId( calHit );

-flags "all wrong"  

-backscatter flag set on initial muons

-vertexIsNotEndpointOfParent is incorrect

-startPoint incorrect

-within tolerance for Mcp not correct

-status bits (review)
  -creation (do in preTracking)
    -createdInSimulator
    -backscatter
    -vertexIsNotEndpointOfParent
  -disposition (mutually exclusive) (do in postTracking)
    -decayedInCal
    -decayedInTracker
    -stopped
      -but *not* decayed
    -left
  -hasEndpointDaughters

-run some Kshorts, lamdas
  -100 events

2/14/2005

minimumTrackingDistance == min travel for particle to be created in
sim generator

neutrinos w/ tracker hits!
  -fixed bug with (<= cut) in G4TrackerSD
    -seems to have fixed a bunch of stuff!

endpoint dau is totally off!

2/15/2005

-starting tracking status is incorrect (now appears to be erroneous bug)
  -picking up parent's region info

-stopped flag = incorrect

-vertex not end of parent flag = incorrect

-decayedInTrackingRegion set when cal!

2/16/2005

-suspicious about hadron calorimeter
  -overlaps?

-possibly SD not aggregating hits correctly

-hcal
  -energy distrib is strange

2/18/05

-energy in GeV for LCIO
-manual setup not correct
-particles w/o final status (decayed, etc.)

2/22/05

-vtxnotendp bug
  -probably fixed (secondaryTrack)

-manual setup not working in LCS
  -probably fixed

-numSecoAtEnd ! correct (?)

-decayC
  -photons
  -above threshhold

-decayT
  -photons below threshhold
  -vtx and endp identical
    -needed manual setup which didn't work!
  -left a tracker hit

-left
  -electrons
  -above 4 MeV
  -thru the beampipe 
    -need lum monitor

-none
  -2 events w/ no status
  -stuck/loopers (need status)

-photons
  -below our energy threshhold
  -vertex and endp look reasonable
  -photon have secondaries at end and have tracker hit
    -all continuous photons below threshhold
    -very little energy
    -tracker hit by stopping
    -how get seco??? 

-electrons
  -ionization electrons not interacting

-vtxNotEndp
  -daughters at endp (after the fact)
  -ex. 
    -muon brems photon
    -photon below threshhold, no tracker hit
    -photon kicks out some electron, below threshhold
    -electrons do leave hit
    -photon stops or pair produces
    -product electron leaves hit
    -electron gets trackID = muon
  -need to flag all daughters past 1st level with this flag
   ("once chain has been broken")
  
2/28/05

-zpoles
  -lambdas w/ kE = 0, probably okay 

-gammas
  -extremely short tracks obscured by hit graphic (WIRED)
  -weird placement of tracker hits
  -possibly "orphaned" hits

3/1/05

-ttbar
  -stdhep to LCIO conv.
    -"dangling" gluons and quarks (needs to be checked against input)
  -some particles (e-) with no final status, similar to looper, but
   no message on this from G4

-muons
  -muon not flagged as decayed in tracker
