<h1>Release Notes - SLIC - Version 2.0</h1>

<h2>I. Overview</h2>

<p>
These are the release notes for the SLIC 2.0 release.  This
corresponds to the CVS tag v2r0p7 in the SLAC CVS.  
<p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.lcsim.org/software/slic/">slic homepage</a>
has links to documentation for this software package.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/ilc/SLIC">SLIC
Wiki</a> is a good source of information where you may add comments,
corrections, etc.
</p>

<h2>II. Getting SLIC</h2>

<p>
The SLIC source code is anonymously accessible using the following command.
</p>

<p>
<i>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.freehep.org:/cvs/lcd co slic</i>
</p>

<p>
The sources can also be <a
href="http://source.freehep.org/jcvsweb/ilc/slic/list/slic">browsed online</a>.

<p>
Binaries are available from the <a href="http://www.lcsim.org/dist/slic/">slic distribution directory</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the SimDist project is a standalone package for building slic
plus all of its dependencies.  It is also accessible via the SLAC cvs.
SimDist can be obtained and built as follows.
</p>

<p>
<i>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.freehep.org:/cvs/lcd co SimDist<br>
cd SimDist<br>
./configure [options]<br>
make
</i>
</p>

<p>
SimDist is the preferred method for users to build slic, as
configuring slic and all 7 of its dependencies from scratch 
is prone to error.
</p>

<p>
These are the current package versions used by SimDist.
</p>

<ul>
<li>clhep v1r9p2_2</li>
<li>gdml v2r5p0_2</li>
<li>geant4 v8r1p02</li>
<li>lcdd v1r11p1</li>
<li>lcio v1r7p2</li>
<li>lcphys v1r0p1</li>
<li>slic v2r0p7</li>
<li>xerces v2r7p0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other versions <i>may or may not work</i>.  In general, only the
versions withint SimDist are tested for compatability.  If you are 
maintaining a slic installation manually without using SimDist, it is 
highly recommended that you update to these package versions or slic may
either fail to build or not work correctly.
</p>

<h2>III. This Release</h2>

<p>
Since the releases for slic have not been very regular, a number of
items from the Jira were reassigned to the 2.0 release in the interest
of consolidation.  All Jira items in the 1.14.0 release were
reassigned to 2.0, and the 1.14.0 release was deleted, as it was 
never released.
</p>

<p>
No major, new features have been introduced this version.  See the
Improvement and New Feature sections for some minor, additional features 
that were added.
</p>

<p>
A few, relatively minor, bugs were fixed.  There has not been any
major reworking of MCParticle codes, etc., though there are still
several outstanding bugs in this area that are currently being worked on.
</p>

<h2>IV. Issue Summary</h2>
